# UI Component Testing Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Component Tests Implemented:**

   - Added comprehensive Jest tests for:
     - Button
     - Alert
     - Card
     - Checkbox
     - Input
     - Select
   - Each component has tests for:
     - Rendering with different variants
     - Handling user interactions
     - Applying custom classes
     - Reference forwarding
     - Accessibility attributes

2. **Storybook Stories Created:**

   - Added Storybook stories for all tested components
   - Stories showcase:
     - Different variants
     - Different sizes
     - Various states (disabled, focused, etc.)
     - Examples with labels and additional content

3. **Project Structure Enhanced:**

   - Created a component tracking table in TODO.md
   - All tests follow a consistent pattern for readability and maintainability

4. **Developer Experience Improved:**
   - Enhanced pre-commit hooks to:
     - Lint code with ESLint (with auto-fixing)
     - Format code with Prettier
     - Run type-checking with TypeScript
     - Run relevant tests
   - Added visual feedback for pre-commit operations

## Next Steps

As outlined in the TODO.md tracking table, the following steps should be prioritized:

1. **Continue Component Testing:**

   - Implement Jest tests for remaining components
   - Create Storybook stories for all components

2. **Accessibility Testing:**

   - Add specific tests for accessibility features
   - Implement keyboard navigation testing

3. **Documentation:**

   - Add detailed usage documentation for each component
   - Document component props and variants

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Create tests for component interactions

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for UI components only
pnpm --filter @repo/ui test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# View test coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Viewing Storybook

```bash
# Start Storybook
pnpm storybook
```

Storybook will be available at http://localhost:6006.
