Remember in e2e testing we are using faker to get fake data in hooks. Dont test against values written by the hook. only test by looking at data-testid. 

Never write e2e test that test navigation and goes to another page. Remove such test if they exist.

make sure all timeouts waiting for element are 1.5 sec
