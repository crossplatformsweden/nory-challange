## Component Implementation Plan

Each component should include:

- TypeScript implementation with proper typing
- Comprehensive Jest tests using React Testing Library
- Storybook stories covering all variants and states
- Accessible implementation using React Aria
- Tailwind CSS styling following TailwindUI conventions

## Testing Strategy

Each component should have tests for:

- Rendering correctly with different props
- Handling user interactions
- Accessibility features
- Keyboard navigation
- State management

## Storybook Strategy

Each component should have stories for:

- All variants
- All sizes
- All states
- Interactive examples
- Documentation with usage guidelines
- Accessibility guidelines

## Workflow

Following the branch `feature/UiComponentsWithJestTesting` and checking `packages/ui/COMPONENT_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed implementation instructions.

## Next Steps

1. Continue adding Storybook stories for remaining components
2. Continue adding Jest tests for remaining components
3. Validate accessibility of all components
4. Add documentation for component usage
